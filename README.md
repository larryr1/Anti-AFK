# Anti-AFK
Windows program to combat Anti-AFK detection.

Anti AFK sends fake keypresses directly to the Windows Message System so it is guarenteed to work with *any* game. Simply open it, select the game, and go AFK.

## Installation
1. Navigate over to the [releases](https://github.com/BlockTInkerer187/anti-afk/releases/) tab and download the latest version.
2. The application is portable. Place it wherever you like, but make sure to include it's DLL files in the same directory (working on a first-time self install system to aid this process),

**If you have an existing version of the application, it will check for updates only when you launch it and notify you if one is available.**

## Project Goals
* Check For Update system
* Better UI/UX
* Make it easier to start/stop Anti AFK
* Learning more about the C family languages as I make it ðŸ˜Ž
